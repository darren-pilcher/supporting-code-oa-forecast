This repository contains the supporting analysis code for the following manuscript:

Pilcher, D.J., Kearney, K.A., Hermann, A.J., Cheng, W., Cross, J.N., and Monacci, N.M. Seasonal Forecasts of pH and Aragonite Saturation for the Bering Sea Shelf.

Due to size restrictions, we are unable to make the entire model simulation output available.  A subset of the output used to generate the manuscript is archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15850609

The analysis code should be runnable and able to generate the manuscript figures using the respective model output.  However, there are a few third-party plotting and utility packages that the code makes use of, which can be downloaded from the [Matlab Central File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/)

The simulations use the [Bering10K-BESTNPZ model](https://github.com/beringnpz/roms-bering-sea.git), specifically the K20P19 version that is archived here https://zenodo.org/records/7062782
